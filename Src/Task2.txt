You parked your car in a parking lot and want to compute the total cost of the ticket. The billing rules are as follows:
• The entrance fee of the car parking lot is 2;
• The first full or partial hour costs 3;
• Each successive full or partial hour (after the first) costs 4.
You entered the car parking lot at time E and left at time L. In this task, times are represented as strings in the format “HH:MW’ (where “HH” is a two-digit number between 0 and 23, which stands for hours, and “MM” is a two-digit number between 0 and 59, which stands for minutes).
Write a function:
int solution(NSString *E, NSString *L);
